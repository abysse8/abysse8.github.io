# 🧠 This page will be a digital exhibit of everything I’ve built, learned, questioned, and half-dreamed.

The core of my research revolves around excitable cells and how they build to interact 3 types of chemistries: those occurring in the cell nucleus, 
transcribing and translating DNA code, with those occuring on either side of the membrane's border. I believe we are on the brink of a novel learning algorithm, potentially performing better than batched backpropagation, used in ChatGPT and essentially all of the state-of-the-art learning models. The mode of operation of DNA transcription, which seems linear and well-normalized (this need to be stated more carefully), gives a hint that the current theory in signal processing (Fourier, Lagrange, Nyquist) is a useful tool for this goal. However, group theory, wavelet analysis, and modern physics' statements of energy conservation and hydrodynamic interactions, have a place to be found in the unified theory of the Microscopic and the Ensemble. I want to understand both!

## 🧪 What is this?

This site is a museum, but also a lab.  
It’s built to be explored, clicked through, broken, and hopefully inspiring.
