title: "J.G's Research Page 🧠: Learning Algorithm & Device Prototyping"
---

# 🧠 This is a digital exhibit of everything I’ve built, learned, questioned, and half-dreamed.  
You'll find simulations, handwritten notes, hardware sketches, and ideas I haven't dared to test yet.

Each room is alive. Wander freely.

## 🗺️ Exhibition Rooms

- [📚 Course Notes](/notes/)  
  Mathematical derivations, circuit theory, biophysics, machine learning. My scratchpad and archive.

- [🧬 Papers & Extracts](/papers/)  
  Quotes and page scans from papers that shifted my worldview — annotated and contextualized.
  
- [🏛️ Hall of Fame](/hall-of-fame/)  
  Talks, debates, landmark papers, and theses that cracked something open in me — or in the world. Curated with awe.
  
- [💡 Projects & Prototypes](/projects/)  
  Interactive simulations, physical builds, weird microcontroller hacks, neural network visualizers.

- [📄 Digital CV](/cv/)  
  Background, past roles, skills, contact. Everything professional, but still personal.

- [📂 Homework & Coursework](/homework/)  
  Final submissions, visual walkthroughs, and things I submitted at 3:59am.

- [💭 Ideas & Fragments](/ideas/)  
  Raw ideas, sketches, wild concepts I’m not sure make sense — but they might.

## 🧪 What is this?

This site is a museum, but also a lab.  
It’s built to be explored, clicked through, broken, and hopefully inspiring.
