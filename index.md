The core of my research revolves around excitable cells and how they build to interact 3 types of chemistries: those occurring in the cell nucleus, 
transcribing and translating DNA code, with those occuring on either side of the membrane's border. I believe we are on the brink of a novel learning algorithm, potentially performing better than batched backpropagation, used in ChatGPT and essentially all of the state-of-the-art learning models. The mode of operation of DNA transcription, which seems linear and well-normalized (this need to be stated more carefully), gives a hint that the current theory in signal processing (Fourier, Lagrange, Nyquist) is a useful tool for this goal. However, group theory, wavelet analysis, and modern physics' statements of energy conservation and hydrodynamic interactions, have a place to be found in the unified theory of the Microscopic and the Ensemble. I want to understand both!

  Quotes and page scans from papers that shifted my worldview — annotated and contextualized.
  
- [🏛️ Hall of Fame](/hall-of-fame.html)  
  Talks, debates, landmark papers, and theses that cracked something open in me — or in the world. Curated with awe.
  
- [💡 Projects & Prototypes](/projects.html)  
  Interactive simulations, physical builds, weird microcontroller hacks, neural network visualizers.

- [📄 Digital CV](/cv.html)  
  Background, past roles, skills, contact. Everything professional, but still personal.

- [📂 Homework & Coursework](/homework.html)  
  Final submissions, visual walkthroughs, and things I submitted at 3:59am.

- [💭 Ideas & Fragments](/ideas.html)  
  Raw ideas, sketches, wild concepts I’m not sure make sense — but they might.

- [🖥️ Presentation Gallery](/presentations.html)  
  Final project deliverables, slideshows, and talk decks — where research met the classroom and I tried to make it sing.

## 🧪 What is this?

This site is a museum, but also a lab.  
It’s built to be explored, clicked through, broken, and hopefully inspiring.
